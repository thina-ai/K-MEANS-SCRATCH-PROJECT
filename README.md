# K-Means Clustering From Scratch

This project implements the K-Means clustering algorithm using NumPy without high-level clustering libraries.

## Features
- Synthetic clustered dataset
- Manual K-Means implementation
- Optimal K selection using Silhouette Score
- Cluster visualization
- Convergence analysis

## Libraries
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn (only for dataset and metrics)

## Results
Optimal number of clusters identified as K=3 with strong separation.

## Conclusion
Demonstrates complete unsupervised clustering workflow from scratch.
